# LLM Gateway/API Platform Comprehensive Reference

## Core Components

### API Management & Routing
The routing system serves as the central nervous system of the LLM Gateway, managing the flow of requests to various providers.

Key Features:
- Multi-provider routing: Intelligently distribute requests across providers based on their strengths and availability
- Content-based routing: Analyze prompt content to route to the most suitable model
- Cost optimization: Route requests based on pricing tiers and budget constraints
- Fallback strategies: Automatic failover when primary providers are unavailable
- Load balancing: Distribute load across providers to maintain performance
- Response caching: Store and serve common responses to reduce costs and latency

Implementation Considerations:
- Request transformation for different provider APIs
- Token counting and budget management
- Response format standardization
- Error handling and retry logic

### SLA Monitoring
Comprehensive monitoring ensures service quality and helps maintain performance standards.

Metrics to Track:
- Response latency: End-to-end and provider-specific timing
- Token usage: Consumption patterns and efficiency
- Quality metrics: Response relevance and consistency
- Error rates: By provider, model, and request type
- Availability tracking: Provider uptime and performance degradation
- Token efficiency: Cost per useful output

Monitoring Strategy:
- Real-time alerting for SLA violations
- Historical trend analysis
- Quality scoring mechanisms
- Cost optimization recommendations

### Delivery Network
A robust delivery network ensures efficient request handling and optimal performance.

Components:
- Edge caching: Distributed caching near users
- Regional routing: Direct requests to nearest available endpoints
- Queue management: Handle traffic spikes and backpressure
- Request batching: Combine similar requests when possible
- Traffic shaping: Control request flow to providers

Architecture Considerations:
- Geographic distribution
- Latency optimization
- Scalability requirements
- Fault tolerance

## Answers to Key Questions

### 1. How to handle multiple provider APIs?

Strategy:
- Create standardized internal API format
- Build provider-specific adapters
- Implement request/response transformation layer
- Maintain provider-specific configuration
- Version control for API changes

Example Implementation:
```typescript
interface LLMRequest {
  prompt: string;
  parameters: {
    temperature: number;
    maxTokens: number;
    topP: number;
  };
  metadata: {
    userId: string;
    useCase: string;
  };
}

class ProviderAdapter {
  async transform(request: LLMRequest): Promise<ProviderSpecificRequest> {
    // Transform to provider-specific format
  }
  
  async handleResponse(response: ProviderResponse): Promise<StandardResponse> {
    // Transform to standard format
  }
}
```
